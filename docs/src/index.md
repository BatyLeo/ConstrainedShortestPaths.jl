# ConstrainedShortestPaths.jl

This package implements general algorithms for solving Generalized Resource Constrained Shortest Paths problems.
It implements a simplified version of the framework from [Parmentier 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07880), restricted to acyclic directed graphs.

To install this package, open a julia Pkg REPL and run the following command:

```bash
pkg> add https://github.com/BatyLeo/ConstrainedShortestPaths.jl
```

> This package is in a development stage, use it at your own risk!
